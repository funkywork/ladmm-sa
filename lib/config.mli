(** Defines the constants of the application. To be modified according to
    governmental updates.

    As the application must be deployable on a static server, this data is
    hardcoded but this will change if a server is set up. Moreover, as the whole
    logic is client driven, it would be possible to imagine a Wordpress plugin
    serving an API consumed by this client. Currently, this data is located in
    the configuration. *)
